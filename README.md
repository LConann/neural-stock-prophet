# Neural Stock Prophet

## Abstract
Stock Price Prediction using a machine learning algorithm helps discover the future value of company stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. Whereas, the existing methods relied highly on model setup and tuning, without considering the variation of data. Also, the machine learning model faces the problems of overfitting and performance limitations. The proposed solution combines several techniques and algorithms to enhance and evaluate the robustness, stability, and interoperability of the stock price prediction algorithm.
* LSTM model with attention mechanisms
* Multiplicative Decomposition
* ARIMA model
* Risk Parity Portfolio
